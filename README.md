# PageCraft
The "PageCraft - MinMaxing your reading" project is an web application designed to help users estimate the time required to finish a book based on their reading speed. Users input the book they want to read and their words-per-minute reading pace, receiving an estimate of the total reading hours.

### **Features:**

1. **Time Estimation:**
    
    - Users input the book title and reading speed to get an estimate of how many hours it would take to complete the entire book.
2. **Optimal Stop Point:**
    
    - An additional feature allows users to specify the time they have available for reading. Given the current page or chapter, the system suggests where to stop to avoid losing track of the plot the next day.
